# Deployment Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Resolved
The deployment was failing due to missing font files (`GeistVF.woff2` and `GeistMonoVF.woff2`) that were referenced in the layout but not included in the project.

## Fix Applied
- Removed custom font imports from `src/app/layout.tsx`
- Updated to use system fonts with Tailwind CSS defaults
- Build now passes successfully locally

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Push Fixed Code to GitHub
```bash
# If you haven't set up the remote yet:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/family-dentist-landing.git

# Push the fix
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Find your project
- Click "Redeploy" or trigger a new deployment
- The build should now succeed

### 3. Verify Deployment
- Check that the site loads correctly
- Test the appointment form
- Verify all sections display properly

## Build Status
✅ **Local build passes successfully**  
✅ **Font loading issues resolved**  
✅ **Ready for production deployment**

The website will use Tailwind's default font stack which provides excellent cross-browser compatibility.
