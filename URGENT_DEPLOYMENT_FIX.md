# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Vercel Deployment Fix Required

## Problem
Vercel is stuck deploying from commit `b50c8c6` (with font errors) instead of `f38e1e2` (with fixes).

## Immediate Solution Required

### Option 1: Manual Vercel Dashboard Fix
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find your `family-dentist-landing` project
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Git**
4. Click **"Disconnect"** from GitHub
5. Click **"Connect Git Repository"** again
6. Select `family-dentist-landing` repository
7. Deploy - this will force it to use the latest commit

### Option 2: Force Branch Update
```bash
# Create a new branch and merge back to force update
git checkout -b deployment-fix
git checkout main
git merge deployment-fix
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

### Option 3: Delete and Recreate Vercel Project
1. Delete the current Vercel project
2. Create a new project
3. Import the repository again
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy

## Why This Happened
- Vercel webhook may not have triggered properly
- GitHub integration might be cached on old commit
- Vercel's git sync is stuck

## Expected Result After Fix
- Build should use commit `f38e1e2` or later
- No font file errors
- Successful deployment

## Verification
Check the deployment logs show:
```
Cloning github.com/Shawnq-create/family-dentist-landing (Branch: main, Commit: f38e1e2)
```
NOT `b50c8c6`
