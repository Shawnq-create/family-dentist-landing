# Vercel Deployment Issue Resolution

## Current Problem
Vercel is deploying from commit `b50c8c6` (which has font errors) instead of the latest commit `765f886` (which has the fixes).

## Solution Steps

### 1. Force New Deployment in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in
2. Find your `family-dentist-landing` project
3. Go to the "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment
5. **OR** go to Settings → Git → disconnect and reconnect the repository

### 2. Alternative: Trigger New Deployment
Make a small change to force a new deployment:

```bash
# Add a comment to trigger new deployment
echo "# Deployment trigger" >> README.md
git add README.md
git commit -m "Trigger new deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 3. Verify Latest Commit
The latest commit should be `765f886` which includes:
- ✅ Font loading fixes
- ✅ Working build configuration
- ✅ All components properly configured

### 4. Check Build Settings in Vercel
Ensure these settings in Vercel dashboard:
- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next`
- **Node.js Version**: 18.x or 20.x

### 5. Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Vercel:
- `RESEND_API_KEY` (optional for testing)
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (optional)

## Expected Result
After redeployment, the build should succeed and show:
- ✅ Build completed successfully
- ✅ No font file errors
- ✅ Website loads properly

The font issue has been resolved by switching to system fonts with Tailwind CSS.
